# EE-Truel
This repository contains two Python programs that calculate and 'graph' various results based on the three-person duel, or 'truel'.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truel

Used in my IB Extended Essay. Code is very messy; admittedly, the point was just to make code that worked for my purposes, not for others to use or examine.
I will maybe fix it someday?

This project uses Pillow, a fork of the Python Imaging Library.

# Version: 1.0
Contains:
- truel_functions: functions used to calculate results and code to iterate over the possibilities
- truel_images: imports truel_functions and Image (from PIL) to create images showing probabilities of winning/player most likely to win for given values of players' accuracies

# TO-DO:
- add comments to explain code
- make programs work with uncommented sections
- add info about truel game and explain context in code
  - define rules, "accuracy"
- show general derivation of formulas
- show sample results?
