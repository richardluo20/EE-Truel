# EE-Truel
Programs that calculate and 'graph' the three person-duel ("truel") players' probabilities of winning.

Used in my IB Extended Essay. Code is very messy; admittedly, the point was just to make code that worked for my purposes, not for others to use or examine.
I will maybe fix it someday?

# TO-DO:
- add comments to explain code
- make programs work with uncommented sections
- add info about truel game and explain context in code
- show general derivation of formulas
- show sample results?
